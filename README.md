![License: Non-Commercial](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Non--Commercial-lightgrey.svg)

> **CyberBuddy** is an interactive cybersecurity awareness website built to educate users on various types of cyber attacks and how to defend against them using **realistic simulations**, **gamified learning**, and **interactive choices**.

---

## 🎓 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to raise awareness about common cybersecurity threats and best practices. The platform simulates real-world attack scenarios in a safe environment and teaches users how their online decisions affect their vulnerability to attacks.

Developed as part of an academic project (Semester 7), CyberBuddy aims to:
- Promote proactive cybersecurity behavior.
- Train users via simulated and interactive modules.
- Make learning about cyber threats engaging and scenario-based.

---

## 🌐 Key Features

### 🧠 Interactive Simulations
Users engage with step-by-step simulations that mimic real cyber attacks. Based on their choices, they receive outcomes and feedback.

### 🚨 Simulated Cyber Attacks
- **Phishing:** Fake email and login traps.
- **Ransomware:** Locked files with ransom warnings.
- **Sniffing:** Fake public Wi-Fi access and data leak.
- **SQL Injection:** Unsafe login field allowing database exploits.
- **Weak Passwords:** Account easily hacked due to poor credentials.
- **Social Engineering:** Tricking users into giving away confidential info.

### 📚 Learning Through Experience
Each simulation teaches users:
- What they did wrong (if they fell for the attack).
- What should’ve been done instead.
- How to prevent such attacks in real life.

## 📖 Modules Description

| Attack Type            | Description                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Phishing**           | Simulated email login asking for credentials. Explains danger of clicking unknown links.  |
| **Ransomware**         | Files shown as locked with ransom message. Educates about backup and malware prevention.  |
| **Sniffing**           | Fake public Wi-Fi simulation. Demonstrates how attackers intercept private info.          |
| **SQL Injection**      | Shows login page vulnerable to SQL code. Warns about unsafe coding practices.             |
| **Weak Passwords**     | Simulates brute-force guessing of easy passwords. Shows importance of strong credentials. |
| **Social Engineering** | Simulates human-based manipulation (like fake phone calls or messages).                   |
